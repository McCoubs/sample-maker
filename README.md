## Decription of Application
Sampling other works has been a staple of the music industry for years, and this application hopes to grow the collaborative spirit of music by allowing anyone to create and use samples.

Samples can be created using the on site instrument emulation, and can be saved and uploaded. Once uploaded the sample will be available to be downloaded by anyone.
After creating an account with the site, the user will be have their own page where they can view all the music they have created, and button that will lead them to the create page where they can use the instruments provided by the site to create and save short pieces of music.

Once the music has been created it will be saved to the database and be available for viewing in the browse page. On this page, the user can check out all of the samples created by the different users of the site. The samples can be sorted by time or popularity. And you can also subscribe to particular users you enjoy listening to. Once you have a sample you would like to use, just hit the download button and you're finished. The site will also keep track of which songs you ahve previously downloaded, so you'll never forget where you got something from.
